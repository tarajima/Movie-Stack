# MovieStack

A simple movie application created with the React framework. Movie data is obtained from The Movie Database API and local storage is used to save ratings and favorited movies.

## Home
<p>The initial home page displays the most popular movies. Users can switch between the Popular, Top Rated, Upcoming, and Now Playing tabs. Doing so will make a call to the proper API endpoint and display the movies for each respective category.</p>
